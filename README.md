###  Requirements
---
* Make domain models for `user`,`product`, `review`.
* Populate the database with sample data including **at least** 100 users, 1000 products, and 1000 reviews for each product.
* Implement methods in your service layer, each demonstrating one of the fetching strategies (`select`, `join`, `subselect`, `batch`).
* Measure the number of SQL queries generated and the execution time for each fetching strategy.
* Analyze the differences in performance among the fetching strategies, focusing on the trade-offs between the number of queries generated and the overall execution time.
* Discuss the scenarios in which each fetching strategy would be most effective, considering factors such as data size, association complexity, and application requirements.

## Submission

* **Report**: Your report should include:
	* An overview of the implemented fetching strategies. For each strategy, have the followings:
		* `Implementation`: Explain how you implement it and write down the query generated by hibernate.
		* `Observation`: Explain the output. For example, Resulted in a total of x SQL queries for fetching y users and their z products.
		* `Performance`: For example, Execution time averaged at 50ms, with a moderate memory usage of 120MB. Data transfer size was relatively low at 300KB, reflecting the efficiency of targeted queries.
		* `Practical Use`: For example, Best suited for scenarios where associated entities are rarely accessed or when the number of associated entities is unknown or highly variable.
	* A detailed analysis of the performance evaluation results. Create charts to show the differences.
		* `Query Execution Time Comparison`: A bar chart displaying the average execution time for each fetching strategy.
		* `Total Number of SQL Queries Generated`: Another bar chart that shows the total number of SQL queries executed for each strategy.
		* `Memory Usage`: A line chart showing the peak memory usage of each fetching strategy during execution.
		* `Data Transfer Size`: A bar chart comparing the amount of data transferred from the database to the application for each fetching strategy.
	* A discussion on the suitability of each fetching strategy for different use cases.
	* Your conclusion from this experiment.
* Fork the repository and push your changes.
* Once you finished your project, send a Pull Request. (Send only one Pull Request once you finish the assignment.)
